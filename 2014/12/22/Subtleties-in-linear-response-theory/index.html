      <h1>Subtleties in linear response theory</h1>
<p class="subtitle">December 22, 2014</p>

<p>In linear response theory, we consider some small perturbation to a Hamiltonian and look at the response of some observable to that perturbation. In the case considered here, the perturbation is an electric field, and the response is current. The linear response that characterizes these quantities is called the conductance.
<!--more--></p>

<p>There’s a problem though, an electric field <em>accelerates</em> a charge. Consider a classical electron for the time being, then</p>

<div class="mathblock"><script type="math/tex; mode=display">
\begin{align}
m \ddot x(t) = - e \mathbf{E}. \label{eq:Newton} \tag{1}
\end{align}
</script></div>

<p>Or in terms of current <span>​<script type="math/tex">j(t) = -e \dot x(t)</script></span>, <span>​<script type="math/tex"> \frac{d j}{dt} = \frac{e^2}{m} \mathbf{E} </script></span>. From here we can quickly and naively go to frequency space to find <span>​<script type="math/tex"> j(\omega) = i \frac{e^2/m}{\omega} \mathbf{E}(\omega) </script></span>. Then one might remember that another way to define <span>​<script type="math/tex">\mathbf{E}</script></span> is in terms of a vector potential that is purely time-dependent, so <span>​<script type="math/tex">\mathbf{E}(\omega) = i \omega \mathbf A(\omega)</script></span>. Now, if we just plug this into our linear response for the current, we get</p>

<div class="mathblock"><script type="math/tex; mode=display"> j(\omega) = - \frac{ e^2}{m} \mathbf A(\omega). \label{eq:jA} </script></div>

<p>All is well and good, right? Well, not quite. In electromagnetism, the constant part of <span>​<script type="math/tex">\mathbf A(t)</script></span> corresponds to the <span>​<script type="math/tex">\omega = 0</script></span> term of <span>​<script type="math/tex">A(\omega)</script></span>. This represents what is known as a “pure gauge”. These gauges are <em>physically equivalent</em> to the null field <span>​<script type="math/tex">\mathbf A(\omega=0) = 0</script></span>. Thus, whatever linear response is represented above at <span>​<script type="math/tex">\omega = 0</script></span> must be unphysical, right?</p>

<p>Wrong.</p>

<p>Before explainging why this is wrong, let’s give some further context to this linear response theory. The term <span>​<script type="math/tex">- e^2/m</script></span> is actually the single particle term of what is known as the “diamagnetic” response to the conductivity when you add in more electrons (usually distributed in a Fermi distribution). This term persists in quantum mechanics, and no other terms appear to cancel it in the simplest case of <span>​<script type="math/tex"> H = \frac{p^2}{2m} </script></span>. In fact, while the math becomes more cumbersome, the solution we shall illustate below holds perfectly well for even the non-interacting multi-electron system.</p>

<p>Now, at this point you may have guessed that there’s something strange going on at <span>​<script type="math/tex">\omega = 0</script></span> due to the fact that the electric field <em>accelerates</em> the particle and doesn’t just have a velocity response. At the <span>​<script type="math/tex">\omega = 0</script></span> point, the <em>physical</em> field <span>​<script type="math/tex">E(\omega)</script></span> seems to necessarily be equal to zero in the gauge we have prescribed unless <span>​<script type="math/tex">A(\omega) \sim 1/\omega </script></span> for small <span>​<script type="math/tex">\omega</script></span>. This would lead to a divergent <span>​<script type="math/tex">j(\omega)</script></span>, restoring our faith that the system is accelerating out of control.</p>

<p>But what about when <span>​<script type="math/tex">\mathbf{A}(\omega=0) = \mathbf{A}_0</script></span>? It seems like then we have a true velocity response to an unphysical object. The solution is subtle: At some point in the quick derivation we made an assumption that implied <span>​<script type="math/tex">\mathbf A(t) \rightarrow 0 </script></span> at <span>​<script type="math/tex"> t \rightarrow -\infty</script></span>. This implies that if <span>​<script type="math/tex">\mathbf A(t) = \mathbf A_0</script></span> at any finite time, there had to be some time in between where <span>​<script type="math/tex">d\mathbf A/ dt \neq 0</script></span>. Thus, during that “ramp up” time, an electric field was on and it accelerated the charge to a specific velocity resulting in the current <span>​<script type="math/tex">j(\omega) = - \frac{ e^2}{m} \mathbf A(\omega)</script></span>.</p>

<p>The assumption is subtle, but the result is rather simple. For now, just assume that <span>​<script type="math/tex">\mathbf A(-\infty) = 0 </script></span> and at some <span>​<script type="math/tex">t_0</script></span>, <span>​<script type="math/tex">\mathbf A(t_0) = \mathbf A_0</script></span>, then we can integrate Eq. \eqref{eq:Newton} to obtain the velocity:</p>

<div class="mathblock"><script type="math/tex; mode=display"> m \dot x (t_0) =  e \int_{-\infty}^{t_0} \frac{d \mathbf A}{d t} d t = e \mathbf A_0. </script></div>

<p>Or, in other words, <span>​<script type="math/tex">\mathbf j(t_0) = -\frac{e^2}{m} \mathbf A_0</script></span>, the same as before! This is how a constant <span>​<script type="math/tex">\mathbf A_0</script></span> can be physical: When it represents the change from a different constant vector potential.</p>

<p>Now, to isolate the assumption, let us run through what they were</p>

<ol>
  <li><span>​<script type="math/tex">\frac{d j}{d t} = \frac{e^2}{m} E(t)</script></span>.</li>
  <li>Take the Fourier transform: <span>​<script type="math/tex"> j(\omega) = i \frac{e^2/m}{\omega} E(\omega)</script></span>.</li>
  <li>Insert vector potential with <span>​<script type="math/tex">E = -\frac{d}{dt} A</script></span> and <em>assume the Fourier transform exists</em> for <span>​<script type="math/tex">A</script></span>: <span>​<script type="math/tex">j(\omega) = - \frac{e^2}m A(\omega)</script></span>.</li>
  <li>Undo the Fourier transform: <span>​<script type="math/tex">j(t) = - \frac{e^2}{m} A(t)</script></span>.</li>
</ol>

<p>Now, let us get the last equation (in #4 above) by a simpler route.</p>

<ol>
  <li><span>​<script type="math/tex">\frac{d j}{dt} = \frac{e^2}{m} E(t)</script></span>.</li>
  <li>Use <span>​<script type="math/tex">E = - \frac{d}{dt} A</script></span> and integrate the above expression from <span>​<script type="math/tex">-\infty</script></span> to <span>​<script type="math/tex">t</script></span>: <span>​<script type="math/tex">j(t) - j(-\infty) = -\frac{e^2}{m} ( A(t) - A(-\infty))</script></span>.</li>
</ol>

<p>Two perfectly legitimate calculations resulting in different results. Firstly, this highlights that the first procedure does actually assume <span>​<script type="math/tex">A(-\infty) = 0</script></span>. Secondly, the only assumptions that could have given <span>​<script type="math/tex">j(-\infty) = 0</script></span> (an assumption we probably wanted anyway) and <span>​<script type="math/tex">A(-\infty) = 0</script></span> are that they could be given in terms of Fourier transforms. In order for a function to have a Fourier transform it needs to be <em>absolutely integrable</em>—i.e. <span>​<script type="math/tex"> \int_{-\infty}^\infty \lvert A(t) \rvert dt \lt \infty</script></span>. Given <span>​<script type="math/tex">A(t)</script></span> as a continuous, piece-wise differentiable function, we need <span>​<script type="math/tex">A(t) \rightarrow 0 </script></span> for <span>​<script type="math/tex">t \rightarrow \pm \infty</script></span>. This imposes our gauge, and since we are not interested in future times let alone <span>​<script type="math/tex"> t \rightarrow +\infty</script></span>, we can artificially modify the function as we see fit to accomodate that. But how the function began at <span>​<script type="math/tex">-\infty</script></span> is important, and we must impose that. Hence, we have chosen, at least partially, a gauge.</p>

<p>We are left with a dilemma then about pure plain waves <span>​<script type="math/tex"> A(t) = A(\omega) e^{-i \omega t}</script></span>. How do those function?</p>

<p>Technically, they are outside of the bounds of the Fourier analysis and we can see that simply by the fact that if we tried to do the above procedure, we couldn’t have a well defined answer as <span>​<script type="math/tex">t \rightarrow -\infty</script></span> (too oscillatory). However, we can approximate the plain wave in terms of an absolutely integrable function <span>​<script type="math/tex"> A_\delta(t) = A(\omega) e^{-i (\omega + i \delta) t}</script></span> for any <span>​<script type="math/tex">\delta \gt 0</script></span>, and everything works. This shows us explicitly that <span>​<script type="math/tex">t = - \infty</script></span> does have <span>​<script type="math/tex"> A_\delta \rightarrow 0</script></span> for all <span>​<script type="math/tex">\delta \gt 0</script></span>. And this is the origin of the well known substitution <span>​<script type="math/tex">\omega \rightarrow \omega + i\delta</script></span>.</p>

<p>The natural question to ask now is how this works for a real system (with dissipation). Why does such a term not exist at zero frequency?</p>

<p>Unless your system is a superconductor, there is some dissipation in the system.
The simplest way to include this is classically: When an electron is going at velocity <span>​<script type="math/tex">\dot x(t)</script></span> it experiences a “drag” that tends to slow it down.
Thus, our Newton’s equations become</p>

<div class="mathblock"><script type="math/tex; mode=display"> m \ddot x(t) = - m \gamma \dot x(t) - e \mathbf E</script></div>

<p>where <span>​<script type="math/tex">\gamma</script></span> describes how much drag the electron experiences.
For more disorder, this would be a larger number.
Playing the same Fourier transform game, we can obtain rather quickly that</p>

<div class="mathblock"><script type="math/tex; mode=display"> j(\omega) = - \frac{e^2}{m} \frac{\omega}{\omega  +i  \gamma}  A(\omega). </script></div>

<p>This is just one step away from the well-known <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drude_model">Drude model</a>.
We see that if <span>​<script type="math/tex">A(t) = A_0</script></span>, then <span>​<script type="math/tex">j(\omega) = 0</script></span>.
But our gauge choice that we described before is still in place, the only difference is that our “kick” at <span>​<script type="math/tex">t=-\infty</script></span> has an infinite time to dissipate back to rest (the inclusion of <span>​<script type="math/tex">\gamma</script></span> above is critical for <span>​<script type="math/tex">j(\omega=0) =0</script></span>).
This also suggests a steady state current when <span>​<script type="math/tex">\mathbf E</script></span> is constant: <span>​<script type="math/tex">m\ddot x=0</script></span> implies <span>​<script type="math/tex">j = \frac{e^2}{m \gamma} \mathbf E</script></span>.
Our current relaxes to zero when there’s nothing around (<span>​<script type="math/tex">\mathbf E = 0</script></span>), as we would expect.</p>

<p>When a quantum mechanical description is done—by taking a random disorder potential and averaging over disorder configurations—one obtains similar results.
The diamagnetic term for a <em>clean system</em> is real and has a physically well defined explanation.</p>

<p>One may not be surprised that this curious “diamagnetic term” occurs for superconductors, however it is sometimes explained that “gauge symmetry is broken” and that is why such a term exists.
This is a misleading statement, but one I will explore in a future post.</p>
