Quasicrystals, a beautiful manifestation of something with a strict crystalline symmetry but nonetheless shows order, have won a [Nobel prize](https://www.nobelprize.org/prizes/chemistry/2011/press-release/) and have recently interested my own work with a dodecagonal graphene quasicrystal making its way into Science{% sidenote 'sn-id-sciencegraphene' '[S. J. Ahn et al., *Science* **361**, 782 (2018)](https://science.sciencemag.org/content/361/6404/782)' %}.

{% marginnote 'mn-id-myresearch' 'We have been studying how quasiperiodicity interplays with materials that have Dirac nodes, including *twisted bilayer graphene*. While we have not studied graphene at 30-degrees like the work in Science, that is an _extreme_ where all crystalline periodicity is lost.'}

This led to this beautiful cover in Science
