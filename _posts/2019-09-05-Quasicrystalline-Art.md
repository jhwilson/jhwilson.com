Quasicrystals, a beautiful manifestation of something without a strict crystalline symmetry but nonetheless shows order, have won a [Nobel prize](https://www.nobelprize.org/prizes/chemistry/2011/press-release/) and have recently interested my own work with a dodecagonal graphene quasicrystal making its way into Science{% sidenote 'sn-id-sciencegraphene' '[S. J. Ahn et al., *Science* **361**, 782 (2018)](https://science.sciencemag.org/content/361/6404/782)' %}.


This led to this beautiful cover in Science

{% marginnote 'mn-id-myresearch' 'We have been studying how quasiperiodicity interplays with materials that have Dirac nodes, including *twisted bilayer graphene*. While we have not studied graphene at 30-degrees like the work in Science, that is an _extreme_ where all crystalline periodicity is lost.' %}
This phenomena is a perfect example of the kind of research I've been doing a lot with these days, and so it inspired the new logo for this website

{% maincolumn 'assets/img/quasicrystal_logo.png' 'Building a Penrose tiling from two sheets of graphene twisted at 30-degrees with respect to each other.' %}

One can tell how this is done: You find the points where two hexagons are on top of each other, put down a point, and connect. There are three shapes: a rhombus, an equilateral triangle, and a square. This can be done along the entire sheet to create an amazing looking pattern. For completeness, we can fill in the rest of the pictured grid to obtain:

The pattern starts to look even more intriguing the further out in the tiling you go.
There is much to learn about such physical systems and their quasiperiodic cousins.
